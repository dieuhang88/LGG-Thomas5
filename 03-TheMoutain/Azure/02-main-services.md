# üîë Key Azure Services Overview with Details and Pricing

## ‚ö° Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run event-driven code without provisioning or managing servers.

- **How it works**:  
  - Write small functions triggered by events such as HTTP requests, timers, or messages from queues.  
  - Azure automatically allocates compute resources and scales based on demand.  
  - You only pay for the time your code runs and the number of executions.

- **Pricing**:  
  - First 1 million requests per month are free.  
  - $0.20 per million executions thereafter.  
  - Additional cost based on memory size and execution time (GB-seconds).

## üóÑÔ∏è Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a **fully managed relational database** built on SQL Server technology.

- **How it works**:  
  - You create a database instance hosted on Azure infrastructure.  
  - Azure handles backups, patching, high availability, and scaling automatically.  
  - Supports familiar SQL language and tools for development and management.  
  - Offers options for performance tiers (DTU or vCore models) based on workload needs.

- **Pricing**:  
  - Basic tier starts around $5/month (DTU-based).  
  - vCore-based pricing begins at about $15/month, with flexibility to choose compute and storage independently.  
  - Backup storage and data egress are charged separately.

## üõ°Ô∏è Azure Key Vault

Azure Key Vault is a **secure cloud service** for managing cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates.

- **How it works**:  
  - Store secrets like database connection strings, API keys, and certificates securely.  
  - Access to secrets is controlled via Azure Active Directory identities and policies.  
  - Azure services such as Functions can retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime without hardcoding sensitive information.

- **Pricing**:  
  - $0.03 per 10,000 operations (including reads and writes).  
  - Additional charges apply if using dedicated hardware security modules (HSMs).

## üîå Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps is a **low-code/no-code workflow automation service**.

- **How it works**:  
  - Create workflows by connecting triggers and actions visually.  
  - Integrate with hundreds of connectors (HTTP, SQL, Blob storage, SaaS services).  
  - Schedule or event-trigger workflows that automate data movement, transformation, and business processes.  
  - Useful for orchestrating multi-step integrations without writing extensive code.

- **Pricing**:  
  - Consumption-based: roughly $0.000025 per action executed.  
  - Premium plans available for isolated environments and enhanced SLAs.

  - Supports continuous deployment from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or local Git repositories.  
  - Built-in auto-scaling, custom domains, SSL certificates, and authentication features.  
  - Manage staging slots for zero-downtime deployments.

- **Pricing**:  
  - Free and shared tiers provide basic hosting for testing or development.  
  - Basic tier starts at approximately $13/month.  
  - Standard and Premium tiers offer more CPU, memory, and advanced features, with prices scaling accordingly.
