# Azure Monitoring: Complete Guide

Monitoring in Azure allows you to track the health, performance, and usage of your cloud resources. It is essential for maintaining uptime, meeting service level objectives, and optimizing costs.

## 🧭 What Is Azure Monitoring?

Azure Monitoring is a suite of tools and services that collect, analyze, and act on telemetry (metrics and logs) from your Azure environment.

It helps:
- Detect and diagnose issues
- Visualize and analyze performance
- Automate alerts and responses
- Monitor infrastructure, applications, and networks

## 🔍 Key Components of Azure Monitoring

### 1. **Azure Monitor**
- Core monitoring service.
- Collects **metrics** (numerical data) and **logs** (text-based data) from all Azure resources.
- Provides a central location for analyzing, visualizing, and alerting on data.

### 2. **Log Analytics**
- A query tool that helps you explore collected logs.
- Uses **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**.
- Allows powerful filtering, grouping, and visualization.

### 3. **Application Insights**
- Monitors application performance and usage.
- Automatically detects performance issues and errors.
- Useful for both developers and non-developers (especially with low-code apps).

### 4. **Azure Alerts**
- Set up rules to detect thresholds or patterns (e.g., high CPU usage).
- Sends alerts via email, SMS, Teams, or automation tools.

### 5. **Workbooks and Dashboards**
- Visual tools for creating interactive reports and status views.
- Great for sharing insights with stakeholders and decision-makers.

### 6. **Activity Log**
- Records all control-plane events (e.g., resource creation, role assignments).
- Helps with auditing and security tracking.

### 7. **Network Watcher**
- Monitors network connectivity, latency, and traffic flow.
- Useful for troubleshooting connection issues and validating routes.

## 📊 Metrics vs Logs

| Feature       | Metrics                      | Logs                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Data Type     | Numeric (e.g., CPU%, latency) | Text-based (events, traces)    |
| Frequency     | Real-time or near real-time   | Collected periodically         |
| Use Case      | Quick health checks           | In-depth investigation         |
| Examples      | CPU, memory, disk usage       | Failed login attempts, errors  |

## ⚙️ Setting Up Monitoring in Azure

### Step 1: Enable Diagnostic Settings
- Configure Azure resources (VMs, storage, etc.) to send data to:
  - Log Analytics
  - Event Hubs
  - Storage Accounts

### Step 2: Connect to Log Analytics Workspace
- A centralized location where monitoring data is sent.
- Enables advanced queries and long-term storage.

### Step 3: Create Metrics and Alerts
- Go to the Azure portal → Monitor → Alerts
- Define conditions (e.g., "CPU > 85% for 5 minutes")
- Choose an action group (email, webhook, function, etc.)

### Step 4: Build Dashboards
- Use Azure Dashboards to pin:
  - Charts
  - Logs
  - Alerts
  - Service health
- Customize for teams (e.g., IT, finance, business ops)

## 🧠 Example Use Cases

### 🔸 Virtual Machines
- Track CPU, disk, and network activity
- Alert if VM becomes unresponsive
- Analyze performance trends over time

### 🔸 Web Applications
- Monitor response times and failure rates
- Detect dependency failures (e.g., database, APIs)
- Visualize usage by region, browser, or device

### 🔸 Cost and Resource Monitoring
- Monitor resource consumption by subscription or group
- Detect sudden usage spikes
- Track underutilized resources to reduce waste

## 🔔 Alerting Example

**Scenario:** Get an alert if your website is down.

1. Set a **metric alert** on HTTP 5xx errors or response time.
2. Define a condition (e.g., "more than 10 failures in 5 minutes").
3. Assign an action group (email your IT team or trigger a Logic App).
4. Monitor via Azure portal or email alerts.

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Tag your resources** consistently for filtering and grouping.
- **Create baseline alerts** for all production workloads.
- **Review logs and metrics** weekly, even if there are no alerts.
- **Use dashboards** to summarize health and costs.
- **Set role-based access** to allow teams to see only relevant data.

## 📎 Summary

Azure Monitoring provides a robust and flexible system for tracking and managing the health of your infrastructure and applications. With tools like Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights, you can gain insights and act quickly — even if you're not a developer.

By setting up alerts, visualizations, and automated actions, you ensure:
- Better uptime
- Faster problem resolution
- Lower operational overhead
- Better stakeholder visibility
