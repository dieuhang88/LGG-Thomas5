At the end you'll find plenty of chambers, some even have water all over and dad even told me there was a river monster, in fact I think I heard it growl once. I'd go again no problem, I just don't want to right now.\n",

    "Geoffrey rushed inside the crack. Yann stayed still. He wouldn't hear the end of it for the rest of his life if he didn't follow. He took a deep breath and entered the cavern hastily. The blinding sunlight made way to pitch blackness. Geoffrey's swift footsteps could still be heard, Yann had to hurry. The cave could not be that deep. Yann was fast, he was going to catch up to his twin brother.\n",

    "The further he went, the wider the tunnel seemed to be getting, but the cave could not be that deep. Geoffrey's running was only a faint tap at this point. Yann had to stop to catch his breath and look around. A white light seemed to glisten at then end of one of the tunnels on his right. Curiosity overtaking fear, he could not resist. The closer he got, the clearer the scene appeared. It was... an old rusty computer screen. On it stood the following:"
