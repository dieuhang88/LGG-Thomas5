$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n} f(i)$$
## What it means
Add the value of $f(i)$ for every integer $i$ starting at 0 and ending at $n$ (inclusive). In code-speak, it‚Äôs a loop that keeps an **accumulator**.\n
### Parts of the notation
- $\\Sigma$ : summation symbol (Greek capital sigma)\n
- $i = 0$ : start value of the index\n
- $n$ : end value of the index (inclusive)\n
- $f(i)$ : function evaluated at each step\n
### Equivalent Python:
```python
total = 0
for i in range(0, n + 1):
    total += f(i)
```
        
## Example
With $f(i)=i^2$ and $n=3$
$$\\sum_{i=0}^{3} i^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14$$
                         
## Bring it to the next level

                         
*‚ÄúA squiggle of sigmas, a mean in the fray,*  
*Subtract, then you square ‚Äî let the outliers play.*  
*Sum it, divide it, then square root the pain,*  
*Deviation‚Äôs a dance 'round the average domain.‚Äù*  

‚Äî *ChatGPT*

Now that you know what the notation means. There is one small function I want you to implement. The formula is the following:
$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2 }$$
Where we have:
- $\\mu$ : What the speared dragon is to the dragon\n

The function you have just implemented is what we more commonly refer to as the Standard Deviation, denoted $\\sigma$.
 We call it a measure of *spread*. There are other measures of spread of course, like range, interquartile-range, variance (which is just the square of the standard deviation).
\nChallenging you with the standard deviation was to get your brain working. But now you understand.
 If most values are far away from the mean, the terms in the sum will be large, so the sum will be large
 and the standard deviation will be large. Conversely, if most values are close to the mean, the terms in the sum will be small, so the sum will be small
 so the standard deviation will be small. It's not rocket science :)\n

If you enjoyed this escape game and have some feedback for it. Maybe there's errors. Maybe ways to make it better. Anyways please give.

There are of course better ways to explore these concepts more in theory.
- I would highly recommend you to wrap up the [introduction to statistics](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics) and [introduction to statistics in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python) from DataCamp. Where they explore these concepts more formally.
- If you want to go over it a little more in detail here are some cool statquest videos
    - On [mean & variance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzZ6GpcfoQY)
    - On [p-values and hypothesis testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vemZtEM63GY)
    - On [statistical distributions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI3hZJqXJuc)
